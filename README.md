# glm-tfidf
glm tfidf logistic and ordinal regression models

This report aims to explore the factors influencing
the perceived quality of rental properties based on data and
tenant reviews from shitrentals.org. By utilizing text analysis
techniques such as TFIDF, the report attempts to model these
factors within a regression framework. Specifically, logistic and
ordinal regression models are employed to handle categorical
and ordinal data. The selection of the most efficient and
accurate predictive model is guided by the F1 score as a
performance metric. This analysis highlights the pivotal role
of rental pricing in shaping tenant experiences, with higher
prices closely linked to superior tenant satisfaction ratings.
